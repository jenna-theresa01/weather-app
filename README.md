# Weather App

## Requirements

[ ] Use "open weather map"s API to fetch weather data

[ ] Allow the user to enter their location (zip code is probably easiest) and press a button to load the weather

[ ] Run an onClick or onSubmit that executes an Axios GET request to retrieve weather data from the API

[ ] Handle successful and unsuccessful attempts

> If the request is successful, display the following in a 'mobile app' format:
>> City name
>> current weather conditions
>> Current temperature in Kelvin, Fahrenheit, and Celsius
>> A unique image, decided by the current temperature (the API has icons built-in, be sure to read the docs)

> If the request is unsuccessful, display a specific error message such as "Invalid Zip Code" or anything else that might come back from the API

[ ] Allow the user to continue entering new zip codes to get new weather data

[ ] Design should include a RESPONSIVE layout utilizing Bootstrap's layout classes that works on both mobile and desktop (with different layouts) and applies atomic design principles for a professional looking presentation

## Stretch Goals

[ ] Use JS to render the entire app (only have a single <div id="main"></div> in the body of your index.html)
